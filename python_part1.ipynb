    "# ● Linked lists: A linked list is a linear data structure that stores data in nodes that are linked together.\n",
    "# ● Stacks: A stack is a LIFO (last in, first out) data structure that stores data in a last-in, first-out order.\n",
    "# ● Queues: A queue is a FIFO (first in, first out) data structure that stores data in a first-in, first-out order.\n",
    "# ● Trees: A tree is a hierarchical data structure that stores data in a parent-child relationship.\n",
    "# ● Graphs: A graph is a non-linear data structure that stores data in a node-edge relationship.\n",

    "# a. Hash tables: A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values.\n",
    "# b. Tries: A trie is a data structure that stores data in a tree-like structure.\n",
    "# c. Heaps: A heap is a data structure that stores data in a priority queue.\n",
    "# d. Skip lists: A skip list is a data structure that combines the properties of linked lists and binary search trees.\n",

    "# In Python, a dictionary is essentially an implementation of a hash table. \n",
    "# Both structures store key-value pairs, allowing for efficient lookups, insertions, and deletions.\n",

    "# In operating systems, data structures are used to manage the memory and files on a computer. \n",
    "# For example, the file system is a data structure that stores information about the files on a computer, such as their names, sizes, and locations.\n",
    "# In databases, data structures are used to store and organize data. For example, a relational\n",
