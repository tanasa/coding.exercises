# VIEW OBJECT :

# In Python, a view object is an object that provides a dynamic view on the underlying data of a dictionary 
# or similar collection. Instead of copying the data, it gives you a real-time view, 
# meaning if the dictionary (or collection) changes, the view object reflects those changes automatically.

# Removing key-value pairs with the .pop() method. 
# .pop() Method for Dictionaries 

# .pop() takes a key as an argument and removes it from the dictionary. 
# At the same time, it also returns the value that it removes from the dictionary.

# In[12]:


# To avoid a KeyError when using the pop() method of a dictionary, you can use one of the following approaches:

# Use the pop() Method with a Default Value
# The pop() method allows you to specify a default value that will be returned 
# if the key does not exist in the dictionary. This prevents a KeyError.

my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}

# 1
# Using pop() with a default value
value = my_dict.pop('c', 'Key not found')  # Returns 'Key not found' if 'c' doesn't exist
print(value)

# Check for the Key Before Popping
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}

# STRINGS


# In[25]:


# Strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters.
# Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1.


# In[26]:


# To access elements of the string.

a = "Hello, World!"
print(a[0])
print(a[1])

# Looping Through a String
# Since strings are arrays, we can loop through the characters in a string, with a for loop.

# Deleting a character in a String

# Since strings in Python are immutable, you can't delete characters directly from them. 
# However, you can create a new string by excluding the characters you want to remove. 

# Here are several methods you can use to "delete" characters from a string:

# 1. Using Slicing
# You can remove a character at a specific index by slicing and joining the parts of the string 
# before and after the character:

string1 = "Hello, World!"
new_string = string1[:2] + string1[3:]
print(new_string)  

# 2. Using replace() method
# If you want to remove all occurrences of a specific character, you can use replace():

string2 = "Hello, World!"
# Remove all 'l' characters
new_string2 = string2.replace('l', '')
print(new_string2)  


# In[33]:


# REPLACE()

original_string = "hello world"
new_string = original_string.replace("o", "a")

print(new_string)  # Output: "hella warld"


# In[34]:


# To replace a character in a string in python at a specific position, there are two methods :


# In[35]:


# Method 1: Using String Slicing

# Slice the string into parts: before the character you want to replace and after it.
# Concatenate the parts with the new character.

original_string = "hello"
position = 1      # Position to replace (0-indexed)
new_char = 'a'   # New character to insert

# Replace the character at the specified position
new_string = original_string[:position] + new_char + original_string[position + 1:]

print(new_string)  # Output: "hallo"


# In[36]:


# Method 2: Using a List

# We can also convert the string to a list, replace the character, and then join it back to a string.

original_string = "hello"
position = 1      # Position to replace (0-indexed)
new_char = 'a'   # New character to insert

# Convert to a list to allow modification
string_list = list(original_string)
string_list[position] = new_char  # Replace the character at the specified position

# Join the list back into a string
new_string = ''.join(string_list)

print(new_string)  # Output: "hallo"


# In[37]:


# To replace the first occurrence of a character in a string in Python, you can use the str.replace() method 
# with an additional argument that specifies the number of occurrences to replace.

string = "Hello, World!"

# Replace the first occurrence of 'o' with 'a'
new_string = string.replace('o', 'a', 1)
print(new_string)  # Output: "Hella, World!"

original_string = "hello, world"
new_string = original_string.replace('o', 'a', 1)  # Replace the first occurrence of 'o' with 'a'

print(new_string)  # Output: "hella, world"
